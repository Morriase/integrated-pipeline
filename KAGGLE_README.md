# Kaggle Training Setup

Your integrated pipeline is now ready to run on Kaggle! Here's how to get your temporal models trained.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download the package**: `kaggle_upload_package.zip` (created above)

2. **Go to Kaggle**: https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks

3. **Create a new notebook**:
   - Click "New Notebook"
   - Choose "Python" environment
   - Enable GPU acceleration (Edit → Settings → Accelerator → GPU)

4. **Upload and extract**:
   ```bash
   # Upload kaggle_upload_package.zip to your notebook
   !unzip kaggle_upload_package.zip
   ```

5. **Run the notebook**: Open `kaggle_training_notebook.ipynb` and execute all cells

## 📋 What Gets Trained

- **4 PyTorch Feedforward Models**: Deep, Wide, Compact, Regularized neural networks
- **4 Sklearn Models**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Extra Trees
- **2 Temporal Models**: LSTM and Transformer for sequence analysis
- **Feature Scalers**: Standardization parameters
- **Ensemble Weights**: Optimized model weighting

## ⏱️ Training Time

- **GPU**: 30-45 minutes
- **CPU**: 2-3 hours
- **Expected Output**: 10 trained models + configurations

## 📥 Download Results

After training completes:
1. The notebook creates `trained_models.zip`
2. Download this file
3. Extract to your local `Model_output/` folder
4. Your server will now load all 10 models including temporal!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**CUDA Out of Memory**:
- Reduce `batch_size` in the config cell
- Change `epochs` to 30

**Slow Training**:
- Ensure GPU is enabled in notebook settings
- Reduce `epochs` if needed

**Missing Files**:
- Make sure `kaggle_upload_package.zip` contains all files
- Check the file listing in the notebook

## 🎯 Expected Results

After successful training, you should see:
```
✅ Server initialized successfully!
Loaded models: 4 PyTorch, 4 sklearn, 2 temporal
```

Your MT5 EA will now receive predictions from all models including the powerful LSTM and Transformer temporal models!

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Kaggle provides free GPU time (up to 30 hours/week)
- Save your notebook after training to avoid losing work
- The trained models will work identically to local training
