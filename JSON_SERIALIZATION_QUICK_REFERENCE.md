# JSON Serialization Fix - Quick Reference

## What Was Fixed
RandomForest and other models were failing to save due to numpy types in metadata that couldn't be serialized to JSON.

## Solution
Added automatic numpy type conversion in `models/base_model.py`:

### Key Method: `_convert_to_json_serializable()`
Recursively converts:
- `np.int64`, `np.int32` → `int`
- `np.float64`, `np.float32` → `float`
- `np.bool_` → `bool`
- `np.ndarray` → `list`
- Nested dicts and lists (recursive)

### Enhanced `save_model()` Method
1. **Always saves model pickle** (critical for deployment)
2. Converts metadata to JSON-safe format
3. Graceful error handling with partial save fallback
4. Logs specific fields that fail

## Usage
No changes needed! The fix is automatic for all models inheriting from `BaseSMCModel`:
- RandomForestSMCModel
- XGBoostSMCModel
- NeuralNetworkSMCModel
- LSTMSMCModel

## Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
python test_json_serialization.py

# Run integration tests
python test_model_save_load.py
```

## Example Output
```
💾 Model pickle saved to models/trained/EURUSD_RandomForest.pkl
💾 Metadata saved to models/trained/EURUSD_RandomForest_metadata.json
✅ Model save complete
```

## Error Handling
If metadata has issues:
```
⚠️ Warning: JSON serialization failed: ...
   Attempting to save partial metadata...
   Skipping field 'problematic_field': ...
💾 Partial metadata saved
```

Model pickle is **always** saved, even if metadata fails.

## Requirements Satisfied
✅ 1.1 - Convert numpy types before JSON serialization
✅ 1.2 - Convert confusion matrix to list
✅ 1.3 - Convert numpy.bool_ and numpy.float64
✅ 1.4 - Handle nested structures
✅ 1.5 - Log errors and continue with partial save
