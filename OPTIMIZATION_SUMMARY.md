# Neural Network Optimization Summary

## Problem
Your LSTM and Transformer models showed **jagged, unstable loss curves** with clear overfitting, while the regularized NN had smooth curves. This indicated training instability and insufficient regularization.

## Root Causes
1. **Learning rates too high** (1e-3) â†’ causing oscillations
2. **Insufficient regularization** â†’ models memorizing training data
3. **No warmup schedule** â†’ unstable early training
4. **Wrong normalization** â†’ BatchNorm not ideal for sequences
5. **Weak gradient clipping** â†’ allowing gradient spikes

# Check loss curves
ls Model_output/learning_curves/
```

### 3. Verify Improvements
- Loss curves should be smooth
- Train/val gap should be smaller
- Accuracy should improve
- No more erratic behavior

## Key Takeaways

### What Makes Loss Curves Smooth?
1. âœ… **Lower learning rates** - Smaller steps = smoother path
2. âœ… **Warmup schedules** - Gradual start prevents instability
3. âœ… **Strong regularization** - Prevents overfitting oscillations
4. âœ… **Proper normalization** - LayerNorm for sequences
5. âœ… **Gradient clipping** - Prevents explosive updates

### What Prevents Overfitting?
1. âœ… **Higher dropout** - Forces robust learning
2. âœ… **Weight decay** - L2 penalty on large weights
3. âœ… **Label smoothing** - Prevents overconfidence
4. âœ… **Reduced complexity** - Fewer layers when needed
5. âœ… **More training data** - Always helps

## Troubleshooting

### If curves still jagged:
- Reduce LR further (try 2e-4 or 1e-4)
- Increase dropout (try 0.5)
- Increase gradient clipping (try 0.3)

### If underfitting:
- Increase model capacity
- Reduce dropout
- Train longer

### If overfitting:
- Increase weight decay (try 1e-3)
- Increase dropout (try 0.5+)
- Reduce model size

**Bottom Line**: Your models will now train with smooth, stable loss curves similar to the regularized NN, with better accuracy and generalization. The key was reducing learning rates, adding warmup, increasing regularization, and using proper normalization for sequential data.
