# Live Trading Inference System - Implementation Tasks

## Completed âœ…
- Server foundation (FastAPI, CORS, logging, config)
- ModelManager (loads RF, XGBoost, NN models with validation)
- Data validation (json_to_dataframe with multi-timeframe parsing)
- Error handling and memory caching
- Health endpoint

---

## Remaining Tasks

- [x] 1. Complete Python Server





  - Wire SMCDataPipeline for live inference (no file I/O)
  - Implement prediction engine using ensemble models
  - Extract SMC context features for EA display
  - Complete POST /predict endpoint with full error handling
  - _Requirements: FR-1.1, FR-1.2, FR-1.3, FR-1.4, FR-1.5, FR-1.6_

- [x] 2. Update MT5 Expert Advisor





  - Collect multi-timeframe data (M15, H1, H4 - 100 bars each)
  - Build JSON request and send to server
  - Parse server response (prediction, confidence, SMC context)
  - Display SMC context on chart with color coding
  - _Requirements: FR-2.1, FR-2.2, FR-2.3, FR-2.4_

- [x] 3. Test & Document




  - Integration test (full request/response cycle)
  - Server setup instructions and API documentation
  - Example requests/responses
  - _Requirements: All FR, TR, PR_

---

## Success Criteria
- Server accepts multi-timeframe JSON and returns predictions < 100ms
- EA collects data, sends requests, displays results
- System runs stable with proper error handling
- Documentation complete

## Timeline: 2-3 days
