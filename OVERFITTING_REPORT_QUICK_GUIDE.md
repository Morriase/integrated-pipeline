# Overfitting Report - Quick Reference Guide

## What It Does
Analyzes all trained models to detect and report overfitting issues, helping you identify models that memorize training data instead of learning generalizable patterns.

## When to Use
- After training models with `train_all_models.py` (runs automatically)
- When reviewing model performance
- Before deploying models to production
- When comparing different training configurations

## Understanding the Reports

### 🚦 Status Indicators

| Gap | Status | Meaning |
|-----|--------|---------|
| < 10% | ✅ Excellent | Model generalizes very well |
| 10-15% | ✅ Good | Acceptable generalization |
| 15-25% | ⚠️ Warning | Overfitting detected, needs attention |
| > 25% | 🚨 Critical | Severe overfitting, immediate action required |

### 📊 Key Metrics

**Train-Val Gap** = Train Accuracy - Validation Accuracy
- **Low gap (< 10%)**: Model learns general patterns
- **High gap (> 15%)**: Model memorizes training data

**Example:**
```
Train Accuracy: 95%
Val Accuracy:   78%
Gap:            17% ⚠️ (Overfitting!)
```

## How to Fix Overfitting

### If Gap is 15-20% (Moderate Overfitting)

#### For Random Forest:
```python
# Reduce max_depth
max_depth=15  # instead of 20

# Increase min_samples_split
min_samples_split=20  # instead of 10

# Limit bootstrap samples
max_samples=0.8
```

#### For Neural Networks:
```python
# Increase dropout
dropout=0.5  # instead of 0.4

# Increase weight decay (L2 regularization)
weight_decay=0.1  # instead of 0.01

# Reduce model size
hidden_dims=[256, 128, 64]  # instead of [512, 256, 128, 64]
```

### If Gap is > 20% (Severe Overfitting)

1. **Apply Data Augmentation**
   - Automatically triggers for datasets < 300 samples
   - Adds Gaussian noise and SMOTE

2. **Use Feature Selection**
   - Reduces dimensionality
   - Removes noisy features
   - Set `apply_feature_selection=True`

3. **Increase Training Data**
   - Collect more samples
   - Use data augmentation
   - Consider transfer learning

4. **Simplify Model**
   - Reduce layers/depth
   - Decrease number of features
   - Use ensemble methods

## Example Workflow

### 1. Train Models
```bash
python train_all_models.py
```

### 2. Review Console Output
Look for ⚠️ warnings:
```
GBPUSD     NeuralNetwork        0.980        0.720        26.00%     ⚠ OVERFITTING
```

### 3. Check Markdown Report
```bash
# Open in any text editor or markdown viewer
models/trained/overfitting_report.md
```

### 4. View Visualization
```bash
# Open the PNG file
models/trained/overfitting_analysis.png
```

### 5. Apply Fixes
Based on recommendations in the report:
- Adjust hyperparameters
- Enable data augmentation
- Apply feature selection
- Increase regularization

### 6. Retrain and Compare
```bash
python train_all_models.py
```
Compare new report with previous to verify improvements.

## Interpreting the Visualization

### Panel 1: Train vs Val Accuracy
- **Blue bars**: Training accuracy
- **Red bars**: Validation accuracy
- **Large gap**: Overfitting issue

### Panel 2: Train-Val Gap
- **Green bars**: Healthy models (gap < 15%)
- **Red bars**: Overfitting models (gap > 15%)
- **Orange line**: 15% threshold

### Panel 3: Gap Distribution
- Shows how gaps are distributed across all models
- Peaks near 0% indicate good generalization
- Long tail to the right indicates overfitting issues

### Panel 4: Model Type Comparison
- Compares average gap by model architecture
- Helps identify which model types are more prone to overfitting
- Useful for selecting best model architecture

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: All Models Overfitting
**Cause:** Dataset too small or too noisy
**Solution:** 
- Enable data augmentation
- Apply feature selection
- Collect more data

### Pattern 2: Only Complex Models Overfitting
**Cause:** Model capacity too high for dataset size
**Solution:**
- Reduce model complexity
- Increase regularization
- Use simpler models

### Pattern 3: One Symbol Overfitting
**Cause:** Symbol-specific data issues
**Solution:**
- Review data quality for that symbol
- Check for data leakage
- Adjust symbol-specific parameters

### Pattern 4: Increasing Gap Over Time
**Cause:** Model memorizing instead of learning
**Solution:**
- Implement early stopping
- Monitor validation loss
- Use learning rate scheduling

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Always check test accuracy** - Validation gap is important, but test accuracy is the ultimate measure

2. **Consider cross-validation metrics** - If CV std is high (> 0.15), model is unstable

3. **Compare with baseline** - Track improvements over time using historical JSON reports

4. **Don't over-optimize** - A small gap (5-10%) is normal and healthy

5. **Balance accuracy and generalization** - Sometimes a slightly lower train accuracy with better generalization is preferable

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No overfitting detected but test accuracy is low
**Cause:** Underfitting - model is too simple
**Solution:** Increase model complexity, add features, train longer

### Issue: Gap is negative (val > train)
**Cause:** Unusual but can happen with small datasets or lucky validation split
**Solution:** Use cross-validation to get more reliable estimates

### Issue: Gap varies significantly between runs
**Cause:** Training instability or random seed effects
**Solution:** Use cross-validation, set random seeds, increase training stability

### Issue: All models show similar gaps
**Cause:** Data quality issues or feature engineering problems
**Solution:** Review data preprocessing, check for data leakage, improve features
