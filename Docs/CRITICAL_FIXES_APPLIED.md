# Critical Fixes Applied to Neural Network & LSTM

## 🔴 Problems Found in `resources/MLP_Progress.txt`:

1. ❌ **NaN Loss** - Training collapsed immediately
2. ❌ **Only 15 epochs** - Stopped way too early (should be 200)
3. ❌ **Wrong architecture** - Using old 256→128→64 instead of 512→256→128→64
4. ❌ **0% win rate** - Predicting only losses
5. ❌ **No gradient clipping** - Causes NaN in deep networks
6. ❌ **Wrong hyperparameters** - train_all_models.py was overriding optimized defaults

---

## ✅ Critical Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Gradient Clipping (CRITICAL for NaN fix)**

**Added to both models:**
```python
loss.backward()
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(self.model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
optimizer.step()
```

**Why**: Prevents gradient explosion that causes NaN loss. Essential for deep networks and RNNs.

---

### 2. **Deeper Architecture**

**Neural Network - Before:**
```python
hidden_dims = [256, 128, 64]  # 3 layers
```

**Neural Network - After:**
```python
hidden_dims = [512, 256, 128, 64]  # 4 layers, much deeper
```

**LSTM - Before:**
```python
hidden_dim = 128, num_layers = 2
```

**LSTM - After:**
```python
hidden_dim = 256, num_layers = 3, bidirectional=True
```

---

### 3. **Fixed Training Parameters in train_all_models.py**

**Before (WRONG):**
```python
history = model.train(
    X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val,
    hidden_dims=[256, 128, 64],  # Old architecture
    dropout=0.3,
    learning_rate=0.001,  # Too low
    batch_size=64,  # Too large
    epochs=100,  # Too few
    patience=15  # Too impatient
)
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```python
history = model.train(
    X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val,
    hidden_dims=[512, 256, 128, 64],  # Deeper
    dropout=0.4,  # Stronger regularization
    learning_rate=0.01,  # Higher for One-Cycle
    batch_size=32,  # Smaller for better generalization
    epochs=200,  # Full One-Cycle
    patience=30,  # More patience
    weight_decay=0.01  # AdamW weight decay
)
```

### 4. **Better Logging**

**Added learning rate tracking:**
```python
current_lr = scheduler.get_last_lr()[0]
print(f"  Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs} - LR: {current_lr:.6f} - "
      f"Train Loss: {train_loss:.4f}, Train Acc: {train_acc:.3f} | "
      f"Val Loss: {val_loss:.4f}, Val Acc: {val_acc:.3f}")
```

**Why**: Monitor One-Cycle LR schedule and detect issues early.

---

### 5. **Increased Epochs**

**Before**: 100-150 epochs
**After**: 200 epochs

**Why**: One-Cycle policy needs full cycle:
- Epochs 1-60: Warmup (LR increases)
- Epochs 61-140: Peak training (high LR)
- Epochs 141-180: Annealing (LR decreases)
- Epochs 181-200: Annihilation (very low LR for fine-tuning)

---

### 6. **Increased Patience**

**Before**: 15-20 epochs
**After**: 30 epochs

**Why**: During One-Cycle, validation loss may temporarily increase during high-LR phase. Need more patience to avoid premature stopping.

---

## 📊 Expected Results After Fixes:

### Before:
```
Epoch 10/100 - Train Loss: nan, Train Acc: 0.482 | Val Loss: nan, Val Acc: 0.325
Early stopping at epoch 15
Win Rate: 0.0%
```

### After (Expected):
```
Epoch 10/200 - LR: 0.004000 - Train Loss: 0.8234, Train Acc: 0.623 | Val Loss: 0.9123, Val Acc: 0.575
Epoch 20/200 - LR: 0.007000 - Train Loss: 0.6891, Train Acc: 0.701 | Val Loss: 0.7654, Val Acc: 0.625
...
Epoch 200/200 - LR: 0.000001 - Train Loss: 0.4123, Train Acc: 0.834 | Val Loss: 0.5234, Val Acc: 0.712
Win Rate: 45-55%
```

## 🚀 Run Optimized Training:

```bash
python train_all_models.py --data_path Data/processed_smc_data_train_optimized.csv
```

---

## 📈 What to Watch For:

### Good Signs:
- ✅ Loss decreases smoothly (no NaN)
- ✅ Training runs for 200 epochs (or stops naturally with patience)
- ✅ Learning rate cycles: low → high → low → very low
- ✅ Validation accuracy improves over time
- ✅ Win rate > 0% (model predicts actual wins)

### Bad Signs (if they occur):
- ❌ NaN loss → Reduce learning rate to 0.005
- ❌ Stops at epoch 30 → Increase patience to 50
- ❌ Still 0% win rate → Need more data (combine multiple symbols)

---

## 💡 If Still Poor Performance:

The fundamental issue is **small dataset** (195 samples). Deep learning needs 10,000+ samples.

**Solutions:**
1. **Combine all symbols** for training (instead of per-symbol)
2. **Use data augmentation** (add noise, shift sequences)
3. **Transfer learning** (pre-train on all symbols, fine-tune per symbol)
4. **Stick with Random Forest/XGBoost** (they work great with small data!)
