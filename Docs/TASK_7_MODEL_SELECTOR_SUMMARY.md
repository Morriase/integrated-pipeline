# Task 7: Model Selection System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive model selection system that automatically identifies the best-performing models per symbol based on quality criteria. The system filters models by overfitting metrics, accuracy thresholds, and stability, then generates deployment manifests for production use.

## Implementation Details

### 1. ModelSelector Class (Subtask 7.1)
**Location:** `train_all_models.py`

Created a new `ModelSelector` class with configurable quality thresholds:
- **max_gap**: Maximum acceptable train-val gap (default: 20%)
- **min_accuracy**: Minimum acceptable test accuracy (default: 55%)
- **stability_threshold**: Maximum acceptable val-test difference (default: 5%)

The class provides clear initialization feedback showing the configured thresholds.

### 2. select_best_models() Method (Subtask 7.2)
**Location:** `train_all_models.ModelSelector.select_best_models()`

Implements intelligent model selection with:

#### Filtering Criteria
1. **Train-Val Gap Filter**: Rejects models with gap > max_gap
2. **Test Accuracy Filter**: Rejects models with accuracy < min_accuracy
3. **Val-Test Consistency Filter**: Rejects models with val-test diff > stability_threshold
4. **Error Handling**: Automatically skips models with training errors

#### Scoring Algorithm
```python
score = test_accuracy - (train_val_gap * 0.5)
```
This formula balances high accuracy with low overfitting by penalizing models with large train-val gaps.

#### Selection Logic
- Selects the model with the highest score among candidates
- Identifies alternative models that also passed filters
- Flags symbols for manual review when no models meet criteria
- Provides detailed console output with selection reasoning

### 3. save_deployment_manifest() Method (Subtask 7.3)
**Location:** `train_all_models.ModelSelector.save_deployment_manifest()`

Generates comprehensive deployment manifests in JSON format containing:

#### Manifest Structure
```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "selection_criteria": {
    "max_train_val_gap": 0.20,
    "min_test_accuracy": 0.55,
    "max_val_test_diff": 0.05
  },
  "selections": {
    "SYMBOL": {
      "selected_model": "ModelName",
      "test_accuracy": 0.72,
      "val_accuracy": 0.70,
      "train_val_gap": 0.13,
      "val_test_diff": 0.02,
      "score": 0.655,
      "reason": "Best score (0.655) with gap 13.0%",
      "alternatives": ["OtherModel"]
    }
  },
  "summary": {
    "total_symbols": 11,
    "models_selected": 9,
    "manual_review_needed": 2,
    "selected_model_types": {
      "XGBoost": 5,
      "NeuralNetwork": 4
    }
  }
}
```

## Requirements Verification

### Requirement 5.1 ‚úÖ
**"WHEN all models finish training THEN the system SHALL rank models by test accuracy"**
- Implemented: Models are scored and ranked using test accuracy as primary metric

### Requirement 5.2 ‚úÖ
**"WHEN selecting models THEN the system SHALL exclude models with train-val gap >20%"**
- Implemented: Configurable max_gap filter (default 20%) rejects overfitting models

### Requirement 5.3 ‚úÖ
**"WHEN selecting models THEN the system SHALL exclude models with test accuracy <55%"**
- Implemented: Configurable min_accuracy filter (default 55%) rejects low-performing models

### Requirement 5.4 ‚úÖ
**"WHEN selecting models THEN the system SHALL prefer models with validation accuracy within 5% of test accuracy"**
- Implemented: stability_threshold filter (default 5%) ensures val-test consistency

### Requirement 5.5 ‚úÖ
**"WHEN no model meets criteria THEN the system SHALL flag the symbol for manual review"**
- Implemented: Returns selection with `action: 'MANUAL_REVIEW_REQUIRED'` when no candidates pass

### Requirement 5.6 ‚úÖ
**"WHEN models are selected THEN the system SHALL save a deployment manifest JSON file"**
- Implemented: save_deployment_manifest() creates comprehensive JSON with all selection details

## Testing

Created comprehensive unit tests in `test_model_selector.py`:

1. **test_model_selector_basic()** ‚úÖ
   - Tests basic selection with clear winner
   - Verifies rejection of models with high gaps
   - Confirms alternative models are identified

2. **test_model_selector_no_candidates()** ‚úÖ
   - Tests scenario where no models meet criteria
   - Verifies manual review flag is set
   - Confirms no model is selected

3. **test_model_selector_with_error()** ‚úÖ
   - Tests handling of models with training errors
   - Verifies errors don't crash selection process
   - Confirms other models are still evaluated

4. **test_deployment_manifest()** ‚úÖ
   - Tests manifest generation
   - Verifies JSON structure and content
   - Confirms file is created correctly

5. **test_scoring_with_overfitting_penalty()** ‚úÖ
   - Tests scoring algorithm
   - Verifies overfitting penalty is applied
   - Confirms balance between accuracy and gap

## Usage Example

```python
from train_all_models import SMCModelTrainer, ModelSelector

# Train all models
trainer = SMCModelTrainer()
results = {}
for symbol in ['EURUSD', 'GBPUSD', 'USDJPY']:
    results[symbol] = trainer.train_all_for_symbol(symbol)

# Select best models
selector = ModelSelector(
    max_gap=0.20,           # 20% max train-val gap
    min_accuracy=0.55,      # 55% min test accuracy
    stability_threshold=0.05 # 5% max val-test diff
)

selections = selector.select_best_models(results)

# Save deployment manifest
manifest = selector.save_deployment_manifest(
    selections, 
    'models/trained/deployment_manifest.json'
)

# Check results
for symbol, selection in selections.items():
    if selection['selected_model']:
        print(f"{symbol}: {selection['selected_model']} "
              f"(acc={selection['test_accuracy']:.3f}, "
              f"gap={selection['train_val_gap']:.1%})")
