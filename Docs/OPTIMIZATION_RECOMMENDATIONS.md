# SMC Pipeline Optimization Recommendations

Based on the results from `resources/results.txt`, here are the key issues and recommended fixes:

## 🔴 Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Win Rate Below Target: 46.0% (Target: >55%)**
- **Current**: 46.5% Loss, 39.6% Win, 14.0% Timeout
- **Problem**: Model is losing more than winning
- **Impact**: Not profitable with 1:3 R:R ratio

### 2. **HTF Confluence Features All Zero**
- **Current**: `HTF_OB_Confluence = 0`, `HTF_FVG_Confluence = 0`
- **Problem**: Multi-timeframe alignment not working
- **Impact**: Missing critical institutional confirmation signals

### 3. **Quality Score Distribution Heavily Skewed**
- **Current**: Q25=0.000, Q50=0.000, Q75=0.000
- **Problem**: Most rows don't have valid SMC structures
- **Impact**: Training on noise instead of signal

---

## ✅ Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Optimize TBM Parameters

**Current Settings:**
```python
rr_ratio=3.0,           # 1:3 Risk-Reward (too aggressive)
lookforward=20,         # 20 candles timeout (too short)
fuzzy_quality_threshold=0.3  # Too lenient
```

**Recommended Settings:**
```python
rr_ratio=2.5,           # 1:2.5 Risk-Reward (more achievable)
lookforward=30,         # 30 candles timeout (more time to develop)
fuzzy_quality_threshold=0.4  # Stricter quality filter
```

**Implementation:**
- Already updated in `run_complete_pipeline.py`
- Re-run pipeline with new parameters

---

### Fix 2: Filter Training Data to Valid Setups Only

**Problem:** 
- Training on 110,000 rows where most have `TBM_Entry = 0` (no setup)
- Only 9,343 rows have actual labeled trades
- Quality scores are 0 for non-setup rows

**Solution:**
```bash
python optimize_training_data.py
```

**What it does:**
1. Filters to only rows with `TBM_Entry != 0`
2. Removes rows with `TBM_Label = NaN`
3. Applies quality threshold (>= 0.5)
4. Balances class distribution
5. Creates regime-specific datasets

**Expected Result:**
- Train set: ~5,000-6,000 high-quality setups
- Balanced classes: ~33% Win, ~33% Loss, ~33% Timeout
- Higher average quality scores

---

### Fix 3: Diagnose and Fix HTF Confluence

**Run Diagnostic:**
```bash
python diagnose_htf_confluence.py
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. **HTF structures not detected** → Lower `fuzzy_quality_threshold`
2. **Time alignment issue** → Check if M15/H1/H4 data overlaps
3. **Proximity too strict** → Increase from 3 ATR to 5 ATR
4. **Lookback window too small** → Increase from 20 to 50 candles

**Fix in Pipeline:**
Edit `data_preparation_pipeline.py` line ~1150:
```python
# Current
lookback_start = max(0, htf_current_idx - 20)

# Recommended
lookback_start = max(0, htf_current_idx - 50)  # Increase lookback
```

And line ~1180:
```python
# Current
proximity_fuzzy = self.fuzzy_classifier.mf.triangular(
    distance_atr, a=0.0, b=0.0, c=3.0  # 3 ATR proximity
)

# Recommended
proximity_fuzzy = self.fuzzy_classifier.mf.triangular(
    distance_atr, a=0.0, b=0.0, c=5.0  # 5 ATR proximity (more lenient)
)
```

---

### Fix 4: Regime-Specific Models

**Current Approach:** Single model for all market conditions
**Problem:** Setups work differently in trending vs ranging markets

**Solution:** Train separate models per regime

**Implementation:**
```python
# After running optimize_training_data.py
# You'll have regime-specific datasets in Data/regime_specific/

# Train models:
python train_all_models.py --regime High_Vol_Trend
python train_all_models.py --regime Low_Vol_Chop
python train_all_models.py --regime Normal
```

**Expected Improvement:**
- High_Vol_Trend: OB setups work better → Higher win rate
- Low_Vol_Chop: FVG mean reversion works better
- Normal: Balanced approach

---

### Fix 5: Feature Engineering Improvements

**Add These Features:**

1. **Time-Based Features:**
```python
df['Hour'] = df['time'].dt.hour
df['DayOfWeek'] = df['time'].dt.dayofweek
df['IsLondonSession'] = ((df['Hour'] >= 8) & (df['Hour'] <= 16)).astype(int)
df['IsNYSession'] = ((df['Hour'] >= 13) & (df['Hour'] <= 21)).astype(int)
```

2. **Momentum Features:**
```python
df['Price_Change_5'] = df['close'].pct_change(5)
df['Price_Change_10'] = df['close'].pct_change(10)
df['Volume_MA_Ratio'] = df['volume'] / df['volume'].rolling(20).mean()
```

3. **Structure Interaction Features:**
```python
df['OB_FVG_Alignment'] = (
    ((df['OB_Bullish'] == 1) & (df['FVG_Bullish'] == 1)) |
    ((df['OB_Bearish'] == 1) & (df['FVG_Bearish'] == 1))
).astype(int)

df['Structure_Quality_Product'] = (
    df['OB_Quality_Fuzzy'] * df['FVG_Quality_Fuzzy']
)
```
