# üöÄ What to Run Next

## You've Just Applied Aggressive Anti-Overfitting Fixes

All 4 model types have been updated with aggressive regularization to fix the severe overfitting (25-69% train-val gaps).

## Option 1: Quick Test (Recommended First) ‚ö°

Test all 4 models on a single symbol to verify the fixes work:

```bash
python test_aggressive_fixes.py
```

**What it does:**
- Tests RandomForest, XGBoost, Neural Network, and LSTM on EURUSD
- Uses new aggressive default parameters
- Shows before/after comparison
- Verifies no exploding gradients
- Runtime: ~5 minutes

**Success looks like:**
```
FINAL RESULT: 4/4 models passed success criteria
üéâ ALL MODELS PASSED! Aggressive fixes are working!
```

## Option 2: Full Training on Kaggle üèÉ

If quick test passes, run full training on all symbols:

### Step 1: Upload to Kaggle
```bash
# From your local machine
kaggle datasets version -m "Aggressive anti-overfitting fixes" -p .
```

### Step 2: Run Training Notebook
Use the Kaggle notebook with this code:

```python
# In Kaggle notebook cell
!python train_all_models.py --symbols all --models all
```

**What it does:**
- Trains all 44 models (11 symbols √ó 4 models)
- Uses new aggressive parameters
- Saves results to `training_results.json`
- Runtime: ~5 minutes on Kaggle GPU

### Step 3: Download Results
```bash
# From Kaggle notebook
from IPython.display import FileLink
FileLink('training_results.json')
```

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Good Signs
- Train-Val gaps < 20% (was 25-69%)
- No exploding gradients in LSTM (was 10-88k norm)
- XGBoost train accuracy < 95% (was 99-100%)
- Validation loss stable (not diverging)
- Test accuracy within 10% of validation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Signs
- Train-Val gaps still > 25%
- LSTM still exploding
- Validation accuracy drops significantly
- Training takes much longer than expected

### ‚ùå Bad Signs (Need Rollback)
- All models fail to train
- Validation accuracy < 40% for all models
- Training crashes or hangs
- NaN losses

## If Results Are Good

1. Document improvements in `Docs/training_progress_v2.txt`
2. Compare with original `Docs/training_progress.txt`
3. Calculate improvement metrics:
   - Average train-val gap reduction
   - Number of models with gap < 15%
   - LSTM stability improvements

## If Results Need Adjustment

### If gaps still > 20%
Make regularization even more aggressive:
```python
# In respective model files
# RandomForest: max_depth=6, min_samples_split=40
# XGBoost: learning_rate=0.005, max_depth=2
# Neural Network: hidden_dims=[64,32,16], dropout=0.6
# LSTM: hidden_dim=16, learning_rate=0.00005
```

### If accuracy too low (<50%)
Relax regularization slightly:
```python
# In respective model files
# RandomForest: max_depth=10, min_samples_split=25
# XGBoost: learning_rate=0.02, max_depth=4
# Neural Network: hidden_dims=[256,128,64], dropout=0.4
# LSTM: hidden_dim=48, learning_rate=0.0002
```

## If You Need to Rollback

```bash
# Restore all models
git checkout models/random_forest_model.py
git checkout models/xgboost_model.py
git checkout models/neural_network_model.py
git checkout models/lstm_model.py

# Or restore specific model
git checkout models/lstm_model.py
```

## Quick Reference

### Files Modified
- `models/random_forest_model.py` - Shallower trees, more pruning
- `models/xgboost_model.py` - Slower learning, stronger regularization
- `models/neural_network_model.py` - Smaller network, more dropout
- `models/lstm_model.py` - Smaller LSTM, aggressive gradient clipping

## Expected Timeline

1. **Quick test:** 5 minutes
2. **Review results:** 2 minutes
3. **Upload to Kaggle:** 2 minutes
4. **Full training:** 5 minutes
5. **Download & analyze:** 3 minutes

**Total:** ~17 minutes from start to finish

## üéØ Recommended Action

**START HERE:**
```bash
python test_aggressive_fixes.py
```

This will verify the fixes work before running full training on Kaggle.

Good luck! üöÄ
