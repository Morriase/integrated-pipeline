    'xgb': xgboost.predict_proba(X),
    'nn': neural_network.predict_proba(X),
    'lstm': lstm.predict_proba(X)
}

# Weighted average
weights = {'rf': 0.25, 'xgb': 0.35, 'nn': 0.25, 'lstm': 0.15}
ensemble_proba = sum(predictions[m] * weights[m] for m in predictions)

# Final prediction
final_prediction = np.argmax(ensemble_proba, axis=1)
```
