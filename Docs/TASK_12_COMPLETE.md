  "training_results": {...},
  "model_selections": {...},
  "warnings": [...],
  "timestamp": "2025-10-19T14:18:11"
}
```

## Bug Fixes Applied

### UTF-8 Encoding Issue in Test File
**File:** `test_summary_report.py`
**Issue:** File reading without UTF-8 encoding caused UnicodeDecodeError on Windows
**Fix:** Added `encoding='utf-8'` to all file open operations

**Changes:**
```python
# Before
with open(report_file, 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()

# After
with open(report_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    content = f.read()
```

**Lines Modified:**
- Line 307: Report content verification
- Line 339: EURUSD report verification
- Line 367: GBPUSD report verification

## Integration with Training Pipeline

The reporting system is automatically invoked in the main training orchestrator:

```python
# In train_all_models.py main execution (line 1686)
try:
    trainer.generate_summary_report(model_selections=model_selections)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"\n‚ùå Summary report generation failed: {e}")
```

Reports are generated after:
1. All models are trained for all symbols
2. ModelSelector selects best models per symbol
3. Deployment manifest is saved

## Usage Example

```python
from train_all_models import SMCModelTrainer, ModelSelector

# Initialize trainer
trainer = SMCModelTrainer()

# Train models
symbols = trainer.get_available_symbols()
for symbol in symbols:
    trainer.train_all_for_symbol(symbol)

# Select best models
selector = ModelSelector()
model_selections = selector.select_best_models(trainer.results)

# Generate reports (automatic)
trainer.generate_summary_report(model_selections=model_selections)
```
