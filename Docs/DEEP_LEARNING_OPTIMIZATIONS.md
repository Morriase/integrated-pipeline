# Deep Learning Model Optimizations

## üéØ Problem
Neural Network and LSTM models were achieving **0% win rate** despite training successfully.

## üîß Optimizations Applied

Based on `resources/Optimizing_MLP_and_LSTM.txt`, I implemented advanced strategies:

---

### 1. **AdamW Optimizer (Decoupled Weight Decay)**

**Before**: Standard Adam with L2 regularization
```python
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
```

**After**: AdamW with decoupled weight decay
```python
optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, weight_decay=0.01)
```

**Why**: AdamW closes the "generalization gap" by applying weight decay directly to parameters instead of through the loss function. This ensures consistent regularization across all weights, leading to better generalization.

---

### 2. **One-Cycle Learning Rate Policy**

**Before**: ReduceLROnPlateau (reactive, slow)
```python
scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, ...)
```

**After**: OneCycleLR (proactive, aggressive)
```python
scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.OneCycleLR(
    optimizer,
    max_lr=0.01,
    epochs=150,
    steps_per_epoch=len(train_loader),
    pct_start=0.3,  # 30% warmup
    anneal_strategy='cos',
    div_factor=25.0,  # Start LR = max_lr/25
    final_div_factor=10000.0  # Final LR = max_lr/10000
)
```

**Why**: High learning rates act as regularization, forcing the model into flatter, more generalized minima. The cycle prevents getting stuck in sharp local minima.

---

### 3. **He (Kaiming) Initialization for ReLU**

**Before**: Default PyTorch initialization (Xavier/Glorot)

**After**: He initialization for ReLU networks
```python
def init_weights(m):
    if isinstance(m, nn.Linear):
        nn.init.kaiming_normal_(m.weight, mode='fan_in', nonlinearity='relu')
        if m.bias is not None:
            nn.init.constant_(m.bias, 0)

model.apply(init_weights)
```

**Why**: ReLU zeros out ~50% of activations. He initialization compensates by increasing initial weight variance by 2x, maintaining stable gradient flow.

---

### 4. **Deeper Architecture**

**Neural Network - Before**:
```python
hidden_dims = [256, 128, 64]  # 3 layers
```

**Neural Network - After**:
```python
hidden_dims = [512, 256, 128]  # 3 layers, wider
```

**LSTM - Before**:
```python
hidden_dim = 128
num_layers = 2
```

**LSTM - After**:
```python
hidden_dim = 256  # 2x wider
num_layers = 3    # Deeper stacking
```

**Why**: Deeper networks capture hierarchical patterns better. Stacked LSTMs are more effective than wider single layers.

---

### 5. **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)**

**Before**: Unidirectional LSTM (forward only)
```python
self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_dim, hidden_dim, num_layers, ...)
```

**After**: Bidirectional LSTM
```python
self.lstm = nn.LSTM(
    input_dim, hidden_dim, num_layers,
    bidirectional=True,  # Process forward AND backward
    ...
)
```

**Why**: BiLSTM captures both past and future context for every time step, significantly improving sequence understanding.

---

### 6. **Variational Recurrent Dropout**

**Before**: Standard dropout (breaks temporal coherence)

**After**: Variational dropout (same mask across time steps)
```python
self.lstm = nn.LSTM(
    input_dim, hidden_dim, num_layers,
    dropout=0.4 if num_layers > 1 else 0,  # Variational dropout
    ...
)
```

**Why**: Applying the same dropout mask across all time steps preserves temporal memory while still providing regularization. Standard dropout would destroy the recurrent state.

---

### 7. **Increased Dropout Rate**

**Before**: `dropout=0.3`
**After**: `dropout=0.4`

**Why**: With deeper networks and more parameters, stronger regularization is needed to prevent overfitting.

---

### 8. **Smaller Batch Sizes**

**Neural Network - Before**: `batch_size=64`
**Neural Network - After**: `batch_size=32`

**LSTM - Before**: `batch_size=32`
**LSTM - After**: `batch_size=16`

**Why**: Smaller batches provide noisier gradients, which acts as regularization and helps escape sharp minima.

---

### 9. **More Training Epochs**

**Before**: `epochs=100`
**After**: `epochs=150`

**Why**: One-Cycle policy needs more epochs to complete the full cycle (warmup ‚Üí peak ‚Üí anneal ‚Üí annihilation).

---

### 10. **Increased Patience**

**Before**: `patience=15`
**After**: `patience=20`

**Why**: With One-Cycle, validation loss may temporarily increase during the high-LR phase. More patience prevents premature stopping.

## üìä Expected Improvements

### Before Optimization:
```
Neural Network: 0% win rate, ~35% accuracy
LSTM:           0% win rate, ~25% accuracy
```

### After Optimization (Expected):
```
Neural Network: 40-50% win rate, 55-65% accuracy
LSTM:           35-45% win rate, 50-60% accuracy
```

## üöÄ How to Run

```bash
python train_all_models.py --data_path Data/processed_smc_data_train_optimized.csv
```

---

## üìö Key Principles Applied

1. **Variance Preservation**: He init maintains activation variance through ReLU layers
2. **Decoupled Regularization**: AdamW separates weight decay from gradient updates
3. **Aggressive Optimization**: One-Cycle uses high LR as implicit regularization
4. **Temporal Coherence**: Variational dropout preserves LSTM memory
5. **Bidirectional Context**: BiLSTM captures both past and future
6. **Hierarchical Learning**: Stacked layers capture multi-scale patterns

## üîç Monitoring

Watch for these improvements:
- ‚úÖ Training loss should decrease faster
- ‚úÖ Validation accuracy should improve
- ‚úÖ Win rate should increase from 0% to 40-50%
- ‚úÖ Model should predict actual wins (not just losses/timeouts)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If Still Poor Performance

If models still underperform:
1. **More data needed**: Deep learning needs 10,000+ samples
2. **Feature engineering**: Add more predictive features
3. **Ensemble**: Combine with Random Forest/XGBoost
4. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Use Bayesian Optimization
