SMC MODEL TRAINING - FULL DATASET APPROACH
================================================================================

🎯 Training Strategy:
  - Train on ALL symbols combined (unified dataset)
  - 2,500+ samples (vs 178-295 per symbol)
  - 3 models total (vs 44 models)
  - Better generalization, less overfitting
  - ATR normalization makes features comparable
