ANTI-OVERFITTING CONFIGURATION CHANGES
=====================================
Date: 2025-10-17

PROBLEM: Massive overfitting observed in Random Forest and Neural Networks
- Random Forest: High train accuracy but poor test performance
- Neural Networks: 90%+ train accuracy dropping to 40-50% test accuracy

SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:

1. RANDOM FOREST REGULARIZATION
   --------------------------------
   Changes to models/random_forest_model.py:
   
   - max_depth: 20 → 10
     * Shallower trees prevent memorizing training data
     * Forces model to learn more general patterns
   
   - min_samples_split: 10 → 50
     * Requires more samples before splitting a node
     * Prevents creating overly specific decision rules
   
   - min_samples_leaf: 5 → 25
     * Each leaf must have at least 25 samples
     * Prevents tiny leaves that memorize individual examples
   
   Expected Impact:
   - Lower training accuracy (good - means less memorization)
   - Better generalization to test data
   - More robust feature importance rankings

2. NEURAL NETWORK REGULARIZATION
   --------------------------------
   Changes to models/neural_network_model.py:
   
   a) Architecture Changes:
      - hidden_dims: [512, 256, 128, 64] → [256, 128, 64]
        * Removed largest layer (512 neurons)
        * Smaller network = less capacity to overfit
      
      - dropout: 0.4 → 0.5
        * More aggressive dropout during training
        * Forces network to learn redundant representations
   
   b) Training Hyperparameters:
      - learning_rate: 0.01 → 0.005
        * Slower learning = smoother convergence
        * Less likely to overfit to noise
      
      - batch_size: 32 → 64
        * Larger batches = more stable gradients
        * Better generalization
      
      - patience: 20 → 15
        * Stop earlier when validation stops improving
        * Prevents overfitting in later epochs
      
      - weight_decay: 0.01 → 0.05
        * Stronger L2 regularization
        * Penalizes large weights more heavily
      
      - label_smoothing: 0.1 → 0.15
        * More smoothing = less overconfident predictions
        * Prevents model from being too certain
   
   c) Learning Rate Scheduler:
      - OneCycleLR → ReduceLROnPlateau
        * OneCycle was too aggressive for this problem
        * ReduceLROnPlateau adapts based on validation loss
        * Reduces LR by 50% when validation plateaus for 5 epochs
   
   Expected Impact:
   - Significantly lower training accuracy (60-70% instead of 90%+)
   - Much better test accuracy (hopefully 55-60%)
   - Smaller train-test gap (target: <10% difference)

3. WHAT TO WATCH FOR
   -------------------
   Good signs:
   ✓ Training accuracy decreases (means less overfitting)
   ✓ Test accuracy increases or stays similar
   ✓ Smaller gap between train and test accuracy
   ✓ Validation loss decreases steadily without huge spikes
   
   Bad signs:
   ✗ Training accuracy too low (<50%) - too much regularization
   ✗ Test accuracy drops significantly - need to tune
   ✗ Model stops learning early - may need to adjust patience

4. NEXT STEPS IF STILL OVERFITTING
   ---------------------------------
   Random Forest:
   - Increase min_samples_split to 100
   - Reduce max_depth to 8
   - Try max_features='log2' instead of 'sqrt'
   - Add max_leaf_nodes constraint
   
   Neural Network:
   - Further reduce network size: [128, 64, 32]
   - Increase dropout to 0.6
   - Add more data augmentation
   - Try different architectures (residual connections)
   - Implement mixup or cutmix regularization

5. MONITORING COMMANDS
   --------------------
   After retraining, check:
   
   1. View training curves:
      python visualize_training.py
   
   2. Check overfitting gaps in plots:
      - Look at "Overfitting Analysis" subplot
      - Target: <15% train-test gap
   
   3. Compare model performance:
      - Check "Model Performance Comparison" plot
      - All models should be >50% test accuracy

EXPECTED RESULTS:
-----------------
Before changes:
  Random Forest: Train ~85%, Test ~55% (30% gap)
  Neural Network: Train ~92%, Test ~48% (44% gap!)
  LSTM: Train ~95%, Test ~45% (50% gap!!)

After changes:
  Random Forest: Train ~65%, Test ~58% (7% gap) ✓
  Neural Network: Train ~68%, Test ~56% (12% gap) ✓
  LSTM: Still needs work (separate optimization needed)

Remember: Lower training accuracy is GOOD if test accuracy improves!
The goal is generalization, not memorization.
