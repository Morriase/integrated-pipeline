# Model Optimization Guide - Black Ice Protocol

## Overview
This document outlines the optimizations applied to improve model training stability and accuracy, specifically addressing the poor loss curves observed in LSTM and Transformer models.

## Problem Analysis

### Before Optimization:
- **Regularized NN**: ✅ Smooth loss curves, good convergence
- **Standard NN**: ⚠️ Decent but could be smoother
- **LSTM**: ❌ Jagged, erratic loss curves with overfitting
- **Transformer**: ❌ Jagged, erratic loss curves with overfitting

### Root Causes Identified:
1. **Learning rates too high** - Causing instability and oscillations
2. **Insufficient regularization** - Models memorizing training data
3. **No learning rate warmup** - Especially critical for Transformers
4. **Batch normalization issues** - Not ideal for sequential data
5. **Aggressive gradient updates** - Need tighter clipping

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. LSTM Model Improvements

#### Architecture Changes:
```python
# BEFORE
- BatchNorm1d for input normalization
- dropout=0.3
- No normalization after LSTM
- Simple classifier head

# AFTER
- LayerNorm for input (better for sequences)
- dropout=0.4 (increased regularization)
- LayerNorm after LSTM output
- Enhanced classifier with LayerNorm between layers
- Dropout in attention mechanism
```

#### Training Changes:
```python
# BEFORE
- Learning rate: 1e-3
- Weight decay: 1e-4
- Gradient clipping: 1.0
- No label smoothing

# AFTER
- Learning rate: 5e-4 (50% reduction)
- Weight decay: 5e-4 (5x increase)
- Gradient clipping: 0.5 (more aggressive)
- Label smoothing: 0.1
- Warmup schedule: 5 epochs
```

**Expected Impact**: Smoother loss curves, reduced overfitting, better generalization

---

### 2. Transformer Model Improvements

#### Architecture Changes:
```python
# BEFORE
- num_layers=4
- dropout=0.1
- Standard Post-LN architecture
- No input normalization

# AFTER
- num_layers=3 (reduced complexity)
- dropout=0.2 (doubled)
- Pre-LN architecture (norm_first=True)
- Input projection with LayerNorm + Dropout
- Final LayerNorm in encoder
- Smaller weight initialization (gain=0.5)
```

#### Training Changes:
```python
# BEFORE
- Learning rate: 1e-3
- epochs=30
- CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts

# AFTER
- Learning rate: 3e-4 (70% reduction)
- epochs=50 (more training time)
- Warmup + Cosine Annealing schedule
- Label smoothing: 0.1
```

**Expected Impact**: Dramatically smoother training, better stability, reduced overfitting

---

### 3. Standard Neural Network Improvements

#### Training Changes:
```python
# BEFORE
- Weight decay: 1e-4
- ReduceLROnPlateau patience: 10
- No warmup
- No label smoothing

# AFTER
- Weight decay: 5e-4 (5x increase)
- ReduceLROnPlateau patience: 8
- Warmup schedule: 5 epochs
- Label smoothing: 0.1
```

**Expected Impact**: Even smoother curves, slightly better accuracy

---

## Key Optimization Techniques Explained

### 1. Learning Rate Warmup
**Why**: Prevents large gradient updates early in training that can destabilize the model.

**Implementation**:
```python
warmup_epochs = 5
def lr_lambda(epoch):
    if epoch < warmup_epochs:
        return (epoch + 1) / warmup_epochs  # Linear warmup
    return cosine_schedule(epoch)  # Then cosine decay
```

### 2. Label Smoothing
**Why**: Prevents overconfident predictions and improves generalization.

**Effect**: Instead of [0, 0, 1], targets become [0.033, 0.033, 0.933]

```python
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(label_smoothing=0.1)
```

### 3. Layer Normalization vs Batch Normalization
**Why**: LayerNorm is more stable for sequential data and small batches.

**LSTM/Transformer**: Use LayerNorm
**Standard NN**: Can use either, but LayerNorm is safer

### 4. Pre-LN Transformer Architecture
**Why**: Normalizing before attention/FFN layers (instead of after) improves gradient flow.

```python
encoder_layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(
    norm_first=True  # Pre-LN architecture
)
```

### 5. Gradient Clipping
**Why**: Prevents exploding gradients that cause training instability.

```python
# More aggressive clipping for temporal models
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=0.5)
```

### 6. Weight Decay (L2 Regularization)
**Why**: Penalizes large weights, preventing overfitting.

```python
# Increased from 1e-4 to 5e-4
optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), weight_decay=5e-4)
```

---

## Hyperparameter Tuning Guide

### If Loss Curves Still Jagged:
1. **Reduce learning rate further** (try 1e-4 or 2e-4)
2. **Increase dropout** (try 0.5 for LSTM, 0.3 for Transformer)
3. **Increase gradient clipping** (try 0.3 or 0.2)
4. **Add more warmup epochs** (try 10)

### If Underfitting (High Loss):
1. **Increase model capacity** (more layers/hidden units)
2. **Reduce dropout** (try 0.3 for LSTM, 0.15 for Transformer)
3. **Increase learning rate slightly** (try 7e-4)
4. **Train longer** (more epochs)

### If Overfitting (Train/Val Gap):
1. **Increase weight decay** (try 1e-3)
2. **Increase dropout** (try 0.5+)
3. **Reduce model size** (fewer layers)
4. **Add more data augmentation**

---

## Monitoring Training

### Key Metrics to Watch:
1. **Train/Val Loss Gap**: Should be < 0.05 for good generalization
2. **Loss Smoothness**: Should decrease monotonically (mostly)
3. **Learning Rate**: Should decrease gradually
4. **Gradient Norms**: Should stay < 1.0 after clipping

### Red Flags:
- ❌ Val loss increasing while train loss decreasing → Overfitting
- ❌ Both losses oscillating wildly → Learning rate too high
- ❌ Losses not decreasing → Learning rate too low or bad initialization
- ❌ NaN/Inf losses → Gradient explosion (need more clipping)

## Next Steps

### 1. Retrain All Models

```

### 2. Compare Results
- Check new loss curves in `Model_output/learning_curves/`
- Compare validation accuracies
- Verify smoother convergence

### 3. Fine-tune if Needed
- Adjust hyperparameters based on results
- Consider ensemble weighting adjustments
- Test on out-of-sample data

### 4. Production Deployment
- Export best models to ONNX
- Update REST server with new models
- Monitor live performance
