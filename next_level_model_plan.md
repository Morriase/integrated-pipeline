# Next-Level Model: Requirements and Design

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements, goals, and design for advancing the Black Ice Protocol trading model pipeline. The focus is on five key areas:

1. Regime-Aware Models
2. Temporal Architectures (LSTM/Transformer)
3. Volume/Order Flow Feature Engineering
4. Ensemble Methods
5. Advanced Features (Cross-Asset, Volatility Clustering)

---

## 1. Regime-Aware Models
- **Goal:** Improve predictive power by training separate models for different market regimes (e.g., trending vs. ranging).
- **Requirements:**
  - Regime detection logic (e.g., ADX, volatility, custom SMC logic)
  - Labeling of each sample with regime
  - Training and inference pipelines for regime-specific models
- **Design:**
  - Add regime label to dataset
  - Train one model per regime
  - At inference, detect regime and select appropriate model

## 2. Temporal Architectures (LSTM/Transformer)
- **Goal:** Capture temporal dependencies and patterns in price/feature sequences.
- **Requirements:**
  - Sequence data preparation (sliding windows)
  - LSTM/Transformer model architecture
  - Training and validation routines for sequence models
- **Design:**
  - Prepare input as sequences (e.g., 32-timestep windows)
  - Build and train LSTM/Transformer using PyTorch or TensorFlow

## 3. Volume/Order Flow Feature Engineering
- **Goal:** Add predictive power from volume, delta, and order book features.
- **Requirements:**
  - Extraction of volume, tick delta, and order book imbalance features
  - Integration into main feature set
- **Design:**
  - Engineer and add new features to dataset
  - Retrain models with expanded feature set

## 4. Ensemble Methods
- **Goal:** Increase robustness and reduce overfitting by combining multiple models.
- **Requirements:**
  - Training of multiple models (different seeds, architectures, or data splits)
  - Methods for combining predictions (averaging, voting, stacking)
- **Design:**
  - Train and save multiple models
  - Implement ensemble prediction logic

## 5. Advanced Features (Cross-Asset, Volatility Clustering)
- **Goal:** Capture more market structure and inter-market relationships.
- **Requirements:**
  - Cross-asset correlation features (e.g., EURUSD vs. DXY)
  - Volatility clustering/regime-switching features
- **Design:**
  - Engineer and add advanced features
  - Integrate into model training pipeline

---

## General Requirements
- Modular, extensible codebase
- Configurable pipelines (YAML/JSON)
- Comprehensive logging and evaluation
- Documentation and unit tests for all new modules

---

This document will guide the scaffolding and implementation of each advanced modeling step.
