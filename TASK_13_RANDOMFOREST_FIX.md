# Task 13: RandomForest KeyError Fix

## Issue Identified

All RandomForest models failed during Kaggle training with:
```
KeyError: 'is_stable'
```

Error occurred at `models/random_forest_model.py:149`:
```python
self.training_history['cv_is_stable'] = cv_results['is_stable']
```

## Root Cause

The cross-validation was completing successfully and returning the `'is_stable'` key, but the code was using direct dictionary access (`cv_results['is_stable']`) which would fail if the key was missing for any reason.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Safe Dictionary Access
Changed from direct access to `.get()` method with defaults:

```python
# Before (unsafe)
self.training_history['cv_is_stable'] = cv_results['is_stable']

# After (safe)
self.training_history['cv_is_stable'] = cv_results.get('is_stable', True)
```

Applied to all CV result keys:
- `mean_accuracy` → default: 0.0
- `std_accuracy` → default: 0.0  
- `is_stable` → default: True
- `fold_accuracies` → default: []

### 2. Added _clone_model() Method
Implemented the `_clone_model()` method in RandomForestSMCModel to ensure proper cross-validation:

```python
def _clone_model(self):
    """Create a clone of this model for cross-validation"""
    return RandomForestSMCModel(symbol=self.symbol, target_col=self.target_col)
```

## Files Modified

- `models/random_forest_model.py`
  - Lines 146-150: Safe dictionary access for CV results
  - Lines 207-209: Added `_clone_model()` method

## Testing Recommendation

Run a quick test with one symbol to verify the fix:

```python
python train_all_models.py --symbols EURUSD --models RandomForest
```

## Expected Outcome

RandomForest models should now:
1. Complete cross-validation without errors
2. Store CV metrics properly in training history
3. Continue to final model training
4. Save successfully with all metadata

## Next Steps

1. Test the fix locally or on Kaggle
2. If successful, re-run full training pipeline
3. All 11 symbols × 4 models = 44 models should complete
4. RandomForest should achieve similar accuracy to other models (60-80% range)
